Simple sudoku solver in 655 lines of C code

I was waiting for something indefinitely. Luckily though I had my old cute iBook with me, which includes a gcc in it! Even Eclipse! Then I saw the sudoku puzzle in the papers. So I quickly coded a sudoku solver in C. I could have had added many algorithms in it, but I just added the most simplest one and it surprisingly worked in my first try :) This one simple algorithm is able to solve easy leveled sudoku puzzles. Though one can add as many algorithms as necessary. Everything is 655 lines of C code — with all the formatting and the comments (if any). Here’s the code. This will probably be used by some lazy ass students  :)

You can compile by either invoking “make” in Release or Debug directories, or just import the project in Eclipse and enjoy there.
